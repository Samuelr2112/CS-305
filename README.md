Artifact: Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report

1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting firm specializing in individualized financial plans, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The company sought Global Rain's expertise to modernize its operations with a focus on securing its RESTful web API against external threats. The primary issue was identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in their web-based software application to protect sensitive financial data.

2. What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

During the vulnerability assessment, I effectively identified several security weaknesses within Artemis Financial's application, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insufficient authentication mechanisms. Coding securely is crucial as it helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and breaches, thereby maintaining client trust and ensuring regulatory compliance. Secure software adds significant value by safeguarding the company's reputation and financial stability.

3. Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

One challenging aspect was identifying less obvious vulnerabilities, such as those related to business logic or subtle misconfigurations. However, this process was also enlightening as it deepened my understanding of potential attack vectors and the importance of comprehensive security measures.

4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased security layers by implementing robust input validation, securing authentication and authorization processes, and using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. In the future, I would use tools like OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite for thorough vulnerability assessments and apply best practices from the OWASP Top Ten list to prioritize and mitigate risks effectively.

5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

To ensure the software remained functional and secure, I conducted extensive testing after refactoring the code. This included unit tests, integration tests, and penetration testing to detect any newly introduced vulnerabilities. Code reviews and static code analysis tools were also employed to maintain high security and code quality standards.

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used resources such as the OWASP guidelines, security-focused coding practices, and tools like static code analyzers and automated testing frameworks. These resources will be invaluable in future assignments, providing a solid foundation for developing secure applications.

7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

From this assignment, I can showcase my ability to conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment, implement secure coding practices, and ensure the robustness of web applications. Demonstrating these skills highlights my expertise in enhancing software security, which is critical for any potential employer in the software development field.
